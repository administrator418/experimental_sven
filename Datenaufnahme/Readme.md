# Datacollection Script - README

This README explains the scripts for data collection and how the process works.

## Important Information:

- **Run the SLM process** once beforehand in MATLAB.
- Open **two terminals** in `C:` to run the Python script.
- **Save only locally** on the `C:` drive.

You must save everything under the `C:` drive; otherwise, random "Permission Denied" errors will occur after some time. These errors will stop the program and display either a camera error or a permission error. It is always a **permission error** from **Trumpf**.

## How to Run the Process:

- Set a **start time** in the script, and the process will begin automatically from that point.
