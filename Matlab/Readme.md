# Important Setup Instructions

1. **SLM as a Second Screen**  
   The SLM is used as a second screen.

2. **Phasemask Consideration**  
   If you open a window and Windows blanks the screen, the Phasemask will no longer be displayed on the SLM, which can lead to a shutdown.

3. **Do Not Move Windows to the Second Screen**  
   Avoid moving any windows over to the second, "imaginary" screen. Press `Windows + P` to see the display settings. If you move a window too far onto the second screen, it will also cause a shutdown.

4. **Play Music During the Process**  
   It is important to play music during the entire process. Why? If the PC goes into sleep mode or shuts down, the SLM will also shut down. Playing music prevents this by keeping the PC active.
